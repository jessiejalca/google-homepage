THE GOOGLE HOMEPAGE PROJECT

The idea for this project is to effectively clone the Google.com homepage, and as an extra challenge, build a results page. It doesn't have to be perfect, but the objective is to put into practice and become comfortable with the basic front-end skills I've been learning for the past few weeks by deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it.
