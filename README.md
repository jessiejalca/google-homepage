# The Google Homepage Project

The idea for this project is to deconstruct an existing web page and <a href="https://jessiejalca.github.io/google-homepage/">rebuild</a> it, effectively cloning it. This is done with the Google.com homepage and, as an extra challenge, a results page. It's not meant to be perfect or to function exactly like Google, but to make something that looks like it. The objective is to put into practice and become comfortable with the basic front-end skills I've been learning for the past few weeks.
